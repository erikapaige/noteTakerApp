#### NOTES ABOUT THE PROCESS
It was great to see the web development process come full circle, from frontend to backend. When learning about how to build routes the process seemed very linear and straight forward, with little room for error. However, implementing the skills proved that routes have a lot to offer. Making each route active and meeting the request and response functions work proved challenging.
